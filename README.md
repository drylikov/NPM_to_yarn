# NPM to yarn

**Summary**

`npm-to-yarn` is designed to convert NPM CLI commands to their Yarn equivalents (and vice versa).

## Why `npm-to-yarn`?

`npm-to-yarn` is super helpful in documentation, for example in generating code tabs.

## üìú Docs

```js
import convert from 'npm-to-yarn'

// or
// var convert = require('npm-to-yarn')

convert('npm install squirrelly', 'yarn')

// yarn add squirrelly
```

`npm-to-yarn` exposes a UMD build, so you can also install it with a CDN (it exposes global variable `n2y`)

### API

/**
 * Converts between npm and yarn command
 */
export default function convert (str: string, to: 'npm' | 'yarn' | 'pnpm'): string
```

Tests can be run with `npm test`. Multiple tests check that parsing, rendering, and compiling return expected results, formatting follows guidelines, and code coverage is at the expected level.
